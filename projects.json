    "description": "I, along with a few of my fellow high school students, recently completed a research paper on financial literacy. In our paper, we explored how a significant portion of the population lacks basic awareness about managing finances and tends to be lenient or careless with money. The research highlights the urgent need for better financial education, especially among youth and underserved communities. We’ve finished writing the paper and compiled a well-structured document, including a survey we conducted. However, the survey currently has only 60 responses, which we believe is too few to draw strong conclusions. We’re now working on gathering more reviews and feedback to strengthen our findings and increase the impact of our work. Our ultimate goal is to get the paper published on a reputable platform to raise awareness and promote financial being.",
